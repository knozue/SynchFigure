### Here are two Shiny widgets
http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/interactive-docs.html
* Note1: Check "Preview in Window" or "Preview in a Viewer panel". (No preview) gave me nothing after clicking "Run Document" button above. Near future  shiny_presented will be used instead of shiny in runtime (https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny_prerendered.html).

```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20)
  
sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
```
